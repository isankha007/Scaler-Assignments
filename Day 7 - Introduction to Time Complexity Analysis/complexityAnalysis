What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?

Choose the correct answer from below:
Y will always be a better choice for small inputs
X will always be a better choice for all inputs
X will always be a better choice for large inputs
X will always be a better choice for small inputs


In a competition, four different functions are observed. All the functions use a single for loop and within the for loop, same set of statements are executed.

Consider the following for loops:

  A) for(i = 0; i < n; i++)

  B) for(i = 0; i < n; i += 2)

  C) for(i = 1; i < n; i *= 2)

  D) for(i = n; i > -1; i /= 2)
If n is the size of input(positive), which function is the most efficient? In other words, which loop completes the fastest.

Choose the correct answer from below:
B
D
A
C
